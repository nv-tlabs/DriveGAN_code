## Playing with the DriveGAN simulator in Colab
For a rapid set up and to play with the DriveGAN simulator in [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com), a dedicated notebook is provided in this folder.  
Upload the *DriveGAN_Playground.ipynb* notebook to Colab and execute it. A GPU runtime is required: you can switch to this kind of runtime from the *Runtime -> Change runtime type* Colab menu.
